# Drum-kit

Explain the project here. What is it about? What have you done so far? What next? Still in progress or completed?

And also, keep what you made (v0.0) on heroku and then keep updating it. So that you can provide the link here.
If cannot deploy, atleast take a snap of what you made when you run that on your local machine and then put it in here.

People should get a clearer picture of what you made, and this gets more important when you've pinned your repo.

And if not for people, do this for yourself. So that you can keep kinda track and have a progress portfolio.
